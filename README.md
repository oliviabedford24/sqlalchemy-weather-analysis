# sqlalchemy-challenge

This is the Module 10: SQL Alchemy challenge for the Rice University Data Visualization bootcamp. In this challenge, we used SQL Alchemy to analyze and visualize data from weather stations in Hawai'i. 

In the "Resources" folder is contained all of the given csv and sqlite files containing the data I analyzed for this challenge. You can just ignore those files, unless you just really enjoy looking at raw data for some reason (but you do you, boo).

In the "SurfsUp" file are all of the code I personally wrote for this challenge. The "climate_starter" file contains the SQL Alchemy code where I sorted and analyzed the data, as well as two graphs displaying the data. The "app" file contains the Flask code I wrote to create a web app for queries about the weather in Hawai'i.

The code contained in this repository is mine, and mine alone.

Thank you!
